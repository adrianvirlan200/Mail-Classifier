How are you going
Thanks for sending me the photos from your holiday It looks like you had a great time  
How're Leah and the kids And what about your dog Snoopy He was just a puppy last time I saw him 
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to your birthday party I would have loved to come but I was really busy at work and it was hard to get away Thanks for the invitation though  
Would it be possible for you to send me some photos from the party I'd love to see how it all went 
I can't wait until you come to visit in March Do you know how long you'll be staying I'll try to think of some fun things to do 
See you soon
All the best 
Jack
